Your Mission

Take the beginnings of a simple game of Blackjack and fix every issue in the JavaScript file you can find to get the game working. This code does not currently work, so fixing basic syntax errors might be your first task, but there are numerous other issues.

#### The game, once completed, works like so:
- When a player loads the page they get two cards, if those cards totally 21 they win immediately (an alert should appear).
- When the player clicks on "Hit" they are given a new card and the cards are checked for win/loss conditions (see below).
- If the player "hits" and has not gone over 21, they may either "hit" again, or "stand".
- When the player clicks on "Stand" the win/loss conditions are immediately checked (and the result alerted).

#### Win/Loss conditions... if the total is:
- over 21 the player loses
- 19, 20, or 21 they win
- 16, 17, or 18 they push with the dealer (tie)
- under 16 they lose

Good code isn't just about it working, you also need to be able to maintain it properly. Identify areas of improvement for the code, including:

Formatting (code style and consistency)
Breaking code into functions
Removing or refactoring unnecessary code
Proper use of comparison and logical operators
You must not change the HTML code.
